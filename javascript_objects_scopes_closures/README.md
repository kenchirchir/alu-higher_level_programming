# JavaScript Objects, Scopes, and Closures

This project is part of the ALU Higher Level Programming curriculum. The project focuses on JavaScript, specifically working with objects, scopes, and closures. In addition, it involves creating classes and understanding inheritance.

## Description

In this project, we explore object-oriented programming in JavaScript. We build classes that define shapes, such as `Rectangle` and `Square`, and develop methods to manipulate these objects. Additionally, we create utility functions for list manipulation and number conversion.

## Files

- **0-rectangle.js**: Defines an empty `Rectangle` class.
- **1-rectangle.js**: Defines a `Rectangle` class with width and height properties.
- **2-rectangle.js**: Enhances the `Rectangle` class to handle invalid inputs.
- **3-rectangle.js**: Adds a `print()` method to the `Rectangle` class to print the rectangle using the character `X`.
- **4-rectangle.js**: Adds `rotate()` and `double()` methods to modify the dimensions of the rectangle.
- **5-square.js**: Defines a `Square` class that inherits from the `Rectangle` class.
- **6-square.js**: Adds a `charPrint(c)` method to the `Square` class to print using a specified character.
- **7-occurrences.js**: Contains a function `nbOccurences()` to count the number of occurrences of a specific element in a list.
- **8-esrever.js**: Contains a function `esrever()` to reverse a list without using the built-in `reverse()` method.
- **9-logme.js**: Contains a function `logMe()` that logs the number of arguments printed and the current argument value.
- **10-converter.js**: Contains a function `converter()` to convert a number from base 10 to another base.

## Usage

To run the JavaScript files, you'll need Node.js installed on your machine. You can execute each file by using the following command:

```bash
$ node <file-name>
