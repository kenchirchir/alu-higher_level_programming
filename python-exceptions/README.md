Topic:Python - Exceptions

## Introduction
Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program and disrupt the normal flow of instructions. Python provides a robust mechanism for handling exceptions to make programs more resilient and error-resistant.

## about Tasks
This project contains tasks that demonstrate how to handle exceptions in Python. Each task focuses on different aspects of exception handling, from printing elements of a list safely to raising custom exceptions.
