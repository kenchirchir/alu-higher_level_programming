# JavaScript - Web Scraping

## Description
This project involves building web scraping scripts using **Node.js**. You will learn how to manipulate JSON data, make HTTP requests, and work with files. This project is focused on using the deprecated **request** module, which is still widely used in the industry for web scraping purposes.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand why JavaScript programming is amazing.
- Manipulate JSON data in JavaScript.
- Use the `request` and `fetch` APIs for making HTTP requests.
- Read and write files using the `fs` module in Node.js.

## Requirements
- All scripts must be written in **Node.js** (version 10.14.x).
- Use **UTF-8** for reading and writing files.
- All scripts must be semistandard compliant (AirBnB style).
- Do not use `var` in any scripts.
- Install necessary tools:
  - Node.js: `sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`
  - Semistandard: `sudo npm install semistandard --global`
  - Request module: `sudo npm install request --global`
